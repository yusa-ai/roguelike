# Prototype
-----------
A prototype game that I am making with LÃ–VE.
*Prototype* isn't its name, nor does the game have a clear direction in mind.
I am only creating this to extend my knowledge base.

## Features
-----------
- Player and terrain collisions
- Player movement and rotation on the x-axis

## Planned
----------
- A simple HP/Mana HUD
- Enemies
- Music and sound effects

## Libraries
------------
- [anim8](https://github.com/kikito/anim8)
- [hump](https://github.com/vrld/hump)
- [windfield](https://github.com/a327ex/windfield)
